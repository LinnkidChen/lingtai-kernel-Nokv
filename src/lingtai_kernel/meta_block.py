"""Unified per-turn metadata injection.

Single source of truth for "what the agent sees about its own runtime state
on every turn." Both injection sites — text-input prefix (in BaseAgent) and
tool-result stamp (in ToolExecutor) — read from here.

Curate carefully: every field added to `build_meta` ships on every text input
and every tool result.

Channel encoding:
- Tool-result channel: `stamp_meta` flattens the dict into the result dict
  as-is. The LLM sees structured JSON (e.g. ``result["context"]["usage"]``).
- Text-input channel: `render_meta` formats the same dict into a prose
  prefix line. Inbox content is NOT rendered here — it lives in the
  user-turn body, drained by ``_concat_queued_messages`` upstream.

As of 2026-05-02, the meta block no longer carries inbox-drained
notifications. System-source notifications (mail arrival, bounce, future
MCP events) are now delivered as synthetic system(action="notification")
tool-call pairs spliced via tc_inbox; see
docs/plans/2026-05-02-system-notification-as-tool-call.md.

    When ``meta`` is empty, neither the meta fields nor ``_elapsed_ms`` are
    written — matching the pre-existing behaviour of
    ``stamp_tool_result(time_awareness=False)`` exactly. This is deliberate:
    the spec originally claimed ``_elapsed_ms`` always writes, but preserving
    the old time-blind path means a time-blind agent's tool results stay
    free of any timing signal, not just wall-clock. Callers that want a
    timing-only stamp should pass a non-empty meta dict.

    ``_elapsed_ms`` lives here (rather than inside ``build_meta``) because
    it is a per-tool-call measurement — not per-turn agent state — and it
    would be wrong for the same value to appear on the text-input prefix.
    It is written unconditionally after the meta-key loop, so it always
    overrides any identically-named key in ``meta``.
