"""Unified per-turn metadata injection.

Single source of truth for "what the agent sees about its own runtime state
on every turn." Both injection sites — text-input prefix (in BaseAgent) and
tool-result stamp (in ToolExecutor) — read from here.

Curate carefully: every field added to `build_meta` ships on every text input
and every tool result.

Channel encoding:
- Tool-result channel: `stamp_meta` flattens the dict into the result dict
  as-is. The LLM sees structured JSON (e.g. ``result["context"]["usage"]``).
- Text-input channel: `render_meta` formats the same dict into a prose
  prefix line. Inbox content is NOT rendered here — it lives in the
  user-turn body, drained by ``_concat_queued_messages`` upstream.

As of 2026-05-02, the meta block no longer carries inbox-drained
notifications. System-source notifications (mail arrival, bounce, future
MCP events) are now delivered as synthetic system(action="notification")
tool-call pairs spliced via tc_inbox; see
docs/plans/2026-05-02-system-notification-as-tool-call.md.
