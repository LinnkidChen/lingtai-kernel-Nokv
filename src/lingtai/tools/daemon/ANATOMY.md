# core/daemon

Daemon capability (分神) — dispatch ephemeral subagents (分神) that operate
in parallel on the agent's working directory. Each LingTai-backend emanation
is a disposable `ChatSession` with a curated tool surface, not an agent; the
`task` is the complete parent-controlled system instruction; LingTai may add an
optional first-user `prompt` (with an exact default) while external CLI backends
keep `task` as their CLI prompt. The parent may select
role, constraints, and tool-use policy; per-task `skills` paths render into a
compact progressive-disclosure skill catalog; and per-task `mcp` supplies full one-run MCP
registrations serialized as YAML for all backends, loaded as task-scoped MCP
tools by the LingTai backend, mounted through native stdio MCP config for
the Claude print/Codex/OpenCode/Qwen CLI backends, and mounted through native
stdio/HTTP MCP config for Kimi Code via a run-private `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/mcp.json`.
The maintained unified daemon
contract lives in `CONTRACT.md`. MCP-capable backends also get the built-in
`daemon_common` MCP (`src/lingtai/mcp_servers/daemon_common/server.py:1-151`);
its `finish` tool writes `daemon_completion.json`, and only a validated
`finish(status="done")` allows terminal `done`. Parent MCP tools are not
auto-inherited. The daemon-eligible `email` intrinsic is available only when explicitly requested in a task's `tools` list, and daemon tool
calls still pass through the kernel `ToolExecutor`/`ToolCallGuard` path before
any handler runs. Each `daemon.emanate` batch gets a stable `group_id` shared by
every run in that batch, while each daemon still keeps its own `run_id`. Each
LingTai-backend daemon with no preset builds a fresh daemon-scoped `LLMService`
mirroring the parent (provider/model/base_url/key_resolver/context_window) and
preserving the parent's provider defaults, rather than reusing the parent
service. Codex additionally derives a daemon-scoped cache anchor from each run's
`daemon.json`, so the child's `session_id`, `thread_id`, and `prompt_cache_key`
do not collide with the parent agent's cache slot. A preset/manifest `codex_auth_path` (the per-agent Codex
OAuth token file) is among the preserved provider defaults — and is on the
`_llm_defaults_from_manifest` preset allowlist — so preset-driven daemon work
authenticates against the same Codex account as the parent. A per-task
`context_token_limit` (positive int; validated pre-flight in
`_handle_emanate`) is threaded through `_run_emanation` into
`_daemon_provider_defaults` as `codex_compact_token_limit` (Codex) or
`mimo_compact_token_limit` (the native `mimo` provider) — effective only
when the task's resolved provider is one of those two; every other provider
and every external CLI backend ignores it. Omitted, the session falls back
to its own resolved `context_window()` as the threshold. See
`src/lingtai/llm/openai/ANATOMY.md` for the shared `_StandaloneCompactionMixin`
mechanics this threshold drives, and `src/lingtai/llm/mimo/ANATOMY.md` for
MiMo's hard-failure-on-compact-error divergence from Codex's non-fatal
policy. Results are persisted in per-run daemon folders; **every** terminal outcome
(done / failed / cancelled / timeout) is surfaced as a compact
`.notification/system.json` event — never as ordinary parent request text — and
`daemon.json.terminal_notified` is written only after publication succeeds (or
an idempotent retry observes the same published event), so a parent that
dispatched a daemon can safely go idle and be woken when the run ends, without
polling.

## Components

- `daemon/__init__.py` — public capability surface. `get_description`, `get_schema`, and `setup`; the core class is `DaemonManager`, which manages the full emanation lifecycle and parent-stop cleanup. Key internals: `_ToolCollector` (`daemon/__init__.py:743`) intercepts `add_tool` calls during preset-driven capability setup to build a sandboxed tool surface without mutating the parent's registry. `EMANATION_BLACKLIST` (`daemon/__init__.py:65`) prevents recursion by blocking `daemon`, `avatar`, `psyche`, `skills`, and `knowledge`; `_parent_host_tool_floor()` (`daemon/__init__.py:76`) derives the NARROW set of always-on host tools a preset emanation may borrow from the parent — exactly `shell` + the file group (read/write/edit/glob/grep), derived from `CORE_DEFAULTS − EMANATION_BLACKLIST − {mcp}`; optional/provider parent tools (`vision`, `web_search`) are deliberately excluded so a preset that omits/fails a provider cap does not silently fall back to the parent; `_reconcile_terminal_notifications()` (`daemon/__init__.py:1116-1151`) retries terminal run dirs whose published receipt is missing, after stale-parent reaping; `_write_kimicode_mcp_config()` (`daemon/__init__.py:309-337`) writes the run-private Kimi `mcp.json` for stdio and HTTP registrations; `_daemon_intrinsic_surface()` (`daemon/__init__.py:1207`) is the narrow daemon intrinsic bridge for explicitly requested `email` plus the automatic LingTai `compact` schema; `_task_mcp_registrations()` (`daemon/__init__.py:1296`) validates full per-task MCP registrations and renders prompt-safe YAML; `_daemon_common_mcp_registration()` / `_read_daemon_completion()` (`daemon/__init__.py:1390` / `daemon/__init__.py:1460`) add and validate the built-in completion MCP; `_connect_task_mcp_registrations()` (`daemon/__init__.py:1550`) starts task-scoped MCP clients for the LingTai backend; `_daemon_provider_defaults()` (`daemon/__init__.py:1695`) preserves the parent/preset provider defaults for every provider and adds the per-run `daemon.json` cache anchor only for Codex; `_build_tool_surface()` (`daemon/__init__.py:2188-2341`) captures parent MCP names, schemas, and handlers as one coherent generation under the parent's `_mcp_lifecycle_lock` before refresh/stop can copy-swap those projections, then automatically includes `compact`, includes only task-scoped MCP tools rather than auto-inheriting parent MCP tools, and — for preset-driven emanations — preserves the parent's narrow host tool floor (`_parent_host_tool_floor()`: shell + file primitives) that saved presets omit from `manifest.capabilities`, so requested host tools valid in the parent set are not rejected as unknown (resolution is preset-first, then intrinsics/MCP, then parent host fill-in); `_run_emanation()` (`daemon/__init__.py:2074`) is the LingTai-backend worker loop that builds a fresh daemon-scoped service for every no-preset run instead of reusing the parent service, sends LingTai `prompt` (or its exact default) as the first ordinary user message, projects daemon-local runtime/token/context state through `meta_block.attach_daemon_agent_meta` without parent notifications, emits the exact compact warning on every round whose current context usage is at or above 90%, performs sole-call provider-independent `compact` resets while retaining the exact call/result pair, and enforces `finish(done)` before `mark_done`.

- `daemon/system_prompt.py` — package-owned LingTai worker-prompt variant (`daemon/system_prompt.py:1-66`). It keeps the daemon operating contract short, names rather than re-describes host tools, teaches manual-before-first-use and precise `summary=true` use, maps parent `system.summarize` to daemon `compact`, preserves oneshot context plus the complete task, and rejects any final rendered prompt above 20,000 characters instead of truncating constraints. Its sibling architecture is the main-agent system-prompt graph in `src/lingtai/prompts/ANATOMY.md`; the daemon deliberately does not render that full resident section stack.

- `kernel/meta_block.py` — canonical `_meta` envelope/projector. `attach_daemon_agent_meta` carries only the instruction plus daemon-local `agent_state` onto the newest final `ToolResultBlock`; parent notification/communication state is not projected, and no main-agent resident-guidance reference is invented.
- `daemon/claude_interactive.py` — interactive Claude Code daemon backend. **Hidden / not user-selectable:** `claude` / `claude-interactive` were removed from the `get_schema()` `backend` enum and description (`daemon/__init__.py:889-904`); the code path stays only so older callers and stored daemon entries with `backend="claude"` still resolve through `_normalize_backend`/dispatch. New work uses print-mode `claude-p`. This retained PTY bridge is POSIX-only;
Windows headless composition never selects it, and native interactive support
remains deferred until ConPTY has its own accepted adapter. `ClaudeInteractiveBridge` (`daemon/claude_interactive.py:103`) accepts only the persistent Port injected by runtime composition; it never constructs a private adapter and rejects missing injection before managed-workspace, harness, or spawn work. It runs normal interactive `claude` under a PTY from a LingTai-managed workspace, writes the managed system prompt (`daemon/claude_interactive.py:80-96`), prepares empty or explicit-source detached worktrees (`daemon/claude_interactive.py:250-309`), answers terminal probes, injects `SessionStart`/`Stop` hooks via inline `--settings`, relays hook payloads through a FIFO, auto-selects workspace trust only inside the verified managed root (`daemon/claude_interactive.py:535-559`), and parses Claude transcript JSONL into daemon progress/result state.
- `daemon/run_dir.py` — per-emanation filesystem run directory. `DaemonRunDir` owns every filesystem effect for one run: folder layout, `daemon.json` atomic writes, batch `group_id` metadata (`DaemonRunDir.new_group_id()`), JSONL appends, CLI progress events, heartbeat touches, `result.txt`, versioned `daemon.json` data (`data_version`), visible `call_parameters`, terminal state markers, and backend resume-id persistence (`DaemonRunDir.set_session_id(key, value, *, overwrite)` — empty/duplicate values are no-ops returning `False`; `overwrite=False` keeps the first id for OpenCode-family backends; write failures propagate). The `DaemonManager` calls into a `DaemonRunDir` at every lifecycle hook without itself touching the filesystem.
- `adapters/posix/daemon_execution_child_entrypoint.py` — fresh-interpreter execution boundary launched by the supervisor before its watcher. It registers exact execution PID/PGID/start identity and composes the existing production host; it does not duplicate backend parsers. `daemon_resume_owner_entrypoint.py` provides the bounded detached owner for one terminal supported-CLI resume generation. Durable `resume-claims/` records enforce one writer, and `followups/` plus `daemon.json` expose follow-up truth to `daemon(check)`.
- `adapters/posix/process_identity.py` — shared POSIX process-incarnation helper. Linux identities combine boot ID and `/proc/<pid>/stat` start ticks; Darwin/BSD identities use bounded `ps` start time plus PPID. It returns `None` when observation is unavailable, and all ownership-sensitive signal paths refuse unknown or mismatched identities.
- `daemon/runtime.py` — stateless daemon backend runtime primitives shared by the LingTai in-process loop and transitional CLI runners. Port-owned Codex, Cursor, OpenCode-family, Qwen, and Kimi runners use the daemon-local process Port for stderr draining and stdout iteration; only ask workers use a local deadline, while initial streams remain watchdog-owned. The historical private names remain for unmigrated paths and compatibility tests.
- `daemon/CONTRACT.md` — maintained daemon contract for the public tool surface, selected skills catalog/path semantics, MCP registration redaction/native mounting, `daemon_common` completion enforcement, backend implementation status, run artifacts, review triggers, and the acceptance gate for new backend or contract-impacting changes.

- `daemon/interactive_terminal/` — capability-local immutable command/exit values and the
  raw byte-stream `InteractiveTerminalPort`; its separate Contract/Anatomy
  governs interactive children without widening the headless process Port.
- `adapters/posix/interactive_terminal.py` — the persistent POSIX PTY adapter
  injected by `setup()`; manager group/all shutdown and watchdog sweeps own its
  opaque handles, including any handle still live after bridge final release.
  Detached execution composition selects its inherited-group mode and binds the
  same immutable child observation/scope callback before interactive Claude
  injection. Interactive per-handle Stop/timeout/error/cancel never signals the
  inherited group; callback failure reaps the child and closes its PTY master
  before re-raising.

- `daemon/process_port.py` — daemon-local technology-neutral process Port and
  immutable command, opaque handle, and raw exit-receipt value objects. It owns
  no backend parsing, run-directory state, notification, or timeout policy.
- `daemon/posix_process.py` — the POSIX adapter selected by `setup()`. It owns
  `Popen(..., start_new_session=True)` for ordinary manager runs, with a
  detached-composition `start_new_session=False` mode that inherits the
  execution child's group. It owns pipe readers, process-group TERM/KILL
  escalation, bounded wait/reap, Port ownership registration, and the
  immutable post-spawn identity/scope observation callback used to publish
  durable detached child state before stream I/O. Ordinary Ports own private
  process groups; inherited detached Ports signal only their exact child while
  supervisor exact-run reclaim owns the inherited group. Observation callback
  failure is transactional: exact-child reap, registry removal, and callback
  descriptor cleanup happen before the original exception is re-raised.

## Public API

The `daemon` tool exposes five actions:

| Action     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `emanate`  | Spawn one or more subagents with specified task + tools + optional preset |
| `list`     | List running/completed/failed emanations with status and elapsed time |
| `ask`      | Send a follow-up message to a running emanation |
| `check`    | Read-only progress tail: `daemon.json` state + last N events from `events.jsonl` + a compact `artifacts` block (the run's artifact manifest — relative path/size/mtime/role per important file, plus run-level state/result_path/error_path). On in-memory registry miss (e.g. after refresh/molt) falls back to the durable `daemons/*/` run dirs, resolving by full `run_id` (exact) or short `handle` (most-recent, with ambiguity flagged) |
| `list`     | Progressive-disclosure index: active registry + historical run dirs; lazily rebuilds missing/invalid/stale-version `daemon.json` and returns prompt/result previews with search filters |
| `reclaim`  | Cancel all running emanations, shut down CLI process groups/thread pools through the same runtime-shutdown helper used by agent stop, reset ID counter |

Every LingTai worker also receives the intrinsic `compact` tool. Its `action`
is required: explicit `action="manual"` is read-only, explicit `action="run"`
with `_reason` is a repeatable non-terminal sole-call reset, and omission is
refused. The surviving successful reset result is stamped from the fresh retained
context. The final ToolResultBlock of each daemon tool batch carries daemon-local
`_meta.agent_meta`; the parent notification/communication
axis is not inherited.

## Internal Module Layout

```
daemon/__init__.py
  ├── DaemonManager.__init__        — stores agent ref, config ceilings, emanation registry
  ├── handle()                      — top-level dispatcher (emanate/list/ask/check/reclaim)
  ├── _daemon_intrinsic_surface()   — exposes explicitly requested `email` plus the automatic LingTai `compact` schema
  ├── _build_tool_surface()         — under the parent MCP lifecycle lock, snapshots MCP names + schemas + handlers as one generation before refresh/stop depublish can copy-swap them; then auto-includes `compact`, filters other requested tools against blacklist, expands groups, and merges preset/MCP/email surfaces; preset emanations also keep the NARROW parent host floor (`_parent_host_tool_floor()`: shell + file primitives only) so saved presets that omit core caps don't make requested host tools unknown — optional/provider parent tools (vision/web_search) are NOT borrowed and stay unknown unless the preset supplies them
  ├── _instantiate_preset_capabilities() — sets up preset tool surface in a sandbox
  ├── _build_emanation_prompt()     — delegates to `system_prompt.py` for the bounded operating contract, compact host-tool names, complete task, and selected oneshot context
  ├── _run_emanation()              — LingTai worker loop: sends `prompt`/default first, runs ToolExecutor/ToolCallGuard, and performs same-run sole-call compact resets while retaining the exact call/result pair
  ├── _run_claude_interactive_emanation() — `claude` / `claude-interactive` backend; delegates to `run_claude_interactive()` (`daemon/claude_interactive.py:771`) to create the managed workspace, drive the interactive Claude TUI through PTY + hooks + transcript parsing, and persist managed-workspace state.
  ├── _run_claude_code_emanation()  — `claude-p` / compatibility `claude-code` backend; parses `--output-format stream-json --verbose` print-mode events in real time so `claude_session_id`, per-turn text, and tool_use/tool_result land in DaemonRunDir during the run (vs. post-hoc). Claude Code's own `usage` fields are deliberately NOT forwarded to append_tokens (external billing path; semantics don't match the kernel's adapter accounting); `_normalize_claude_usage` requires the primary `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` fields, defaults the optional cache-read/cache-creation fields to zero, and rejects bool/negative/malformed consumed values (matching Codex/Cursor). The first valid terminal `result` event's usage is buffered — not persisted — until after cancellation/timeout, exit code, `is_error`, and `_require_done_completion` (the daemon_common `finish()` MCP contract — itself a terminal acceptance gate: when the run loaded `daemon_common`, a missing/bad `finish()` call fails the run here, before any usage is persisted or `mark_done` runs) are all classified/passed, then persisted exactly once UI-only to `daemon.json.cli_tokens` via `run_dir.record_cli_tokens` (`cached = cache_read + cache_creation` input tokens). Cancellation/timeout observed before the final acceptance check, a later failure classification, or a missing/bad completion sentinel arriving after the terminal line therefore cannot leave false accepted usage; cancellation published after that acceptance point retains the existing best-effort terminal semantics rather than introducing cross-backend atomic arbitration in this path. `_run_ask_claude_code_stream` (the `daemon(ask)` resume follow-up) applies the same buffer-then-classify ordering against its deadline/exit-code/`is_error` gates — resume has no `_require_done_completion` gate — so the TUI `/daemons` view can show accepted usage without touching either token ledger.
  ├── _run_codex_emanation()        — codex backend; parses `codex exec --json` JSONL events (thread.started → codex_session_id, item.completed → agent_message text, turn.completed → terminal). Symmetric with the claude-code backend. A valid terminal `usage` object is normalized to disjoint input (`input_tokens - cached_input_tokens`, clamped at zero), cached input, and output in UI-only `daemon.json.cli_tokens`; the raw object is retained in a `cli_usage` event, with no token-ledger row and at most one terminal account per stream. Codex receives native config overrides for `daemon_common` plus parent-provided stdio MCP registrations, and `finish(done)` is required before success when daemon_common is loaded.
  ├── _run_opencode_emanation()     — Port-owned OpenCode-family runner; builds an immutable grouped command `<executable> <cmd_prefix...> <prompt>` (default prefix `run --format json`) and parses one JSON event per stdout line via defensive helpers (`_opencode_extract_session_id`, `_opencode_extract_text`) because OpenCode-family event field naming is less standardized than claude-code or codex. Session id is stored as `opencode_session_id` (or a caller-supplied family key) in daemon.json on the first event that carries one; terminal-shaped events (`*.completed`, `*.done`, `*.finished`, `result`, `final`) override intermediate streaming text. Non-JSON lines are still recorded as cli_output. `_build_opencode_prompt` wraps the user task with the daemon operating contract (write detailed work product to files; end with a concise final answer). The `executable` / `backend_name` / `session_state_key` / `cmd_prefix` keyword args let MiMo Code and Oh-My-Pi reuse this runner without duplicating the parse loop; the optional `text_extractor` / `error_detector` / `usage_recorder` hooks let a family member override answer extraction, recognize a structured error event that must fail the run even on exit 0, or persist source-specific UI usage (MiMo Code passes all three). The OpenCode backend receives per-run `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` for `daemon_common` and parent-provided stdio MCP registrations; MiMo and Oh-My-Pi reuse the parser but do not yet have evidence-backed MCP config injection.
  ├── _run_mimocode_emanation()     — MiMo Code backend; reuses the OpenCode-family runner around `mimo run --format json <prompt>` (session id stored as `mimocode_session_id`) but injects MiMo's verified 0.1.5 JSONL contract via the runner's `text_extractor` / `error_detector` / `usage_recorder` hooks: `_mimocode_extract_answer_text` surfaces ONLY a `type:text` event's nested `part.text` (reasoning/tool/step `part.text` is ignored), `_mimocode_extract_error` turns a structured `type:error` event into a terminal failure even on exit 0 with a bounded (≤500) `redact_text`-scrubbed detail, and `_mimocode_normalize_usage` accepts only source-shaped `step_finish` parts and records UI-only totals with duplicate `part.id` suppression. Follow-up asks use `_handle_ask_mimocode()` → `mimo run --session <mimocode_session_id> --format json <message>`, applying the same answer/error/usage contract to the resume stream.
  ├── _run_qwen_code_emanation()    — Qwen Code backend; submits an immutable grouped `DaemonProcessCommand` (`qwen --yolo <backend_argv> -p <prompt>`) to the daemon-local Port with no local stdout deadline. `QWEN_CODE_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_PATH` points at a per-run settings file containing `mcpServers.daemon_common` plus parent-provided stdio MCP registrations; Manager records stdout/stderr as cli_output/result text, and intentionally rejects `daemon(action="ask")` until the Qwen CLI exposes a stable resume contract.
  ├── _run_oh_my_pi_emanation()     — Oh-My-Pi (`omp`) backend; OpenCode-family wrapper with `cmd_prefix=["--mode", "json", "--approval-mode", "yolo"]` → spawns `omp --mode json --approval-mode yolo <prompt>`. The OpenCode JSON parser already recognizes Oh-My-Pi's `type:session` header (bare top-level `id`), stored as `oh_my_pi_session_id`. Follow-up asks use `_handle_ask_oh_my_pi()` → `_handle_ask_opencode(..., build_resume_cmd=_oh_my_pi_resume_cmd)` → `omp --mode json --approval-mode yolo --session <oh_my_pi_session_id> <message>`.
  ├── _run_kimicode_emanation()     — Kimi Code (`kimi`) backend; submits `kimi <backend_argv> --prompt <prompt> --output-format text` (owned `--prompt`/`--output-format` follow the free-form backend_argv; `--yolo` forbidden because the CLI rejects it alongside `--prompt`) to the grouped daemon-local Port with no local stdout deadline. Sets a per-run env overlay via `_kimicode_run_env` (`daemon/__init__.py:5205-5252`: run-private `KIMI_CODE_HOME`, telemetry/auto-update off, `KIMI_MODEL_API_KEY` mapped from `KIMICODE_API_KEY`/`KIMI_API_KEY`/`MOONSHOT_API_KEY` only when unset, provider/base-url/model/context defaults only when absent; secrets never logged). For MCP-capable runs, `_handle_emanate_cli` writes `<run>/kimi-code-home/mcp.json` and records only its path in `backend_harness_files` (`daemon/__init__.py:3479-3483`). Records stdout/stderr as cli_output/result text and intentionally rejects `daemon(action="ask")` because no stable session-id/resume contract was verified.
  ├── _run_cursor_emanation()       — Cursor Agent CLI backend; spawns `agent -p --force --output-format stream-json <prompt>` (Cursor's headless print mode with file edits enabled) and parses the version-pinned 2026.05.28-a70ca7c `result.usage` contract into UI-only `cli_tokens`, preserving raw usage and joining model only from a preceding matching `system/init` by `session_id`; it also captures `cursor_session_id` and final `result` text. Ask follow-ups resume with `agent -p --force --resume <cursor_session_id> --output-format stream-json <message>` and use the same usage path.
  ├── _find_claude_session_id()     — legacy `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL scan; now only a fallback when the stream-json `session_id` capture fails
  ├── _handle_emanate()             — validates presets, creates DaemonRunDir, submits to pool
  ├── _handle_list/check/reclaim    — individual action handlers; list scans active entries plus historical run-dir JSON records and performs best-effort lazy daemon.json rebuilds. `_handle_check` tries the in-memory registry first, then falls back to `_resolve_historical_run_dir` so the compact id from a terminal notification still resolves after refresh/molt
  ├── _check_snapshot_from_paths()  — builds the `check` response (daemon.json fields + truncated event tail + `artifacts` block) from a run dir's paths; shared by the live-registry hit and the historical fallback so both surface identical shape
  ├── _artifacts_summary()          — compact artifact-manifest block for `check`: prefers the persisted `artifacts.json` (written at terminal time; `source="manifest"`), else computes a fallback via `DaemonRunDir.build_manifest` for a still-running or pre-manifest run (`source="fallback"`); on any failure returns `source="unavailable"` rather than breaking `check`. Surfaces path/size/mtime/role metadata only — never file contents; artifact entries are run-dir-relative while run-level `result_path`/`error_path` keep the existing absolute-path `check` convention
  ├── _resolve_historical_run_dir() — resolves a compact `run_id` to a durable `daemons/<run_id>/` folder; exact folder-name match wins, while legacy short `handle` lookup is accepted only for a unique match and multi-match ambiguity is rejected without returning every path
  ├── _run_dir_handle()             — best-effort handle for a run dir (daemon.json `handle`, falling back to parsing the folder name) used by historical resolution
  ├── _handle_ask()                 — dispatcher: routes resumable CLI backends (interactive Claude, claude-p/claude-code, codex, opencode, mimocode, oh-my-pi, and cursor) to their async follow-up handlers; returns an explicit unsupported error for qwen-code and kimicode; routes lingtai asks to the in-process followup buffer
  ├── _handle_ask_cli()             — claude-code follow-up via `claude --resume <claude_session_id>`. Spawns the subprocess, hands the stream-json parse to `_ask_pool`, returns `{"status":"sent","async":true}` immediately so the parent's tool turn isn't held for the duration of the follow-up
  ├── _run_ask_claude_code_stream() — background worker for the claude-code ask. Same stream-json parse as `_run_claude_code_emanation`; clears `ask_in_flight` on exit
  ├── _handle_ask_codex()           — codex follow-up via `codex exec resume <codex_session_id> --json`. Symmetric with `_handle_ask_cli`: spawns + dispatches to `_ask_pool`, returns immediately
  ├── _run_ask_codex_stream()       — background worker for the codex ask. Same JSONL parse as `_run_codex_emanation`; `daemon(check)` therefore sees progress on follow-ups too
  ├── _handle_ask_opencode()        — OpenCode-family follow-up via `opencode run --session <opencode_session_id> --format json <message>` by default; callers such as oh-my-pi can pass `build_resume_cmd` to customize the resume argv (`omp --mode json --approval-mode yolo --session <oh_my_pi_session_id> <message>`). Symmetric with claude-code / codex ask: spawns, dispatches to `_ask_pool`, returns immediately. Returns a clear error if the backend-specific session id has not been captured yet.
  ├── _run_ask_opencode_stream()    — background worker for the opencode ask. Same defensive JSON-line parse as `_run_opencode_emanation`; clears `ask_in_flight` on exit; terminal-shaped events override intermediate text

  ├── _arm_batch_done_cancel()      — sets a batch's cancel_event once all its futures finish so the watchdog can't wake later
  ├── _watchdog()                   — per-batch timeout enforcement thread; on timeout kills only its own `cli_group_id` procs
  ├── _on_emanation_done()          — future done-callback: derives the terminal status from `run_dir.state_snapshot()["state"]` (authoritative: done/failed/cancelled/timeout) and publishes the terminal notification for every terminal state, including short successful results; it records a pending claim first, then writes the durable receipt only after publication succeeds (`daemon/__init__.py:6483-6543`). This is the single live-callback funnel that guarantees every terminal outcome wakes the parent.
  ├── _publish_daemon_notification() — publishes one compact `.notification/system.json` event (id, terminal status, task summary, run dir, result/error path, bounded preview); terminal callers pass a stable idempotency key, while follow-up (`ask`) completions call it without receipt state (`daemon/__init__.py:2816-2896`)
  └── _drain_followup()             — drains per-emanation follow-up buffer (lingtai backend only)

  ├── build_manifest() / write_manifest() — `build_manifest(run_path)` is a classmethod pure read over a run dir: lists path/size/mtime/inferred-role for well-known artifacts (priority order) + extra work-product files (sorted, `.tmp` skipped), capped at `_MANIFEST_MAX_ENTRIES` (records `artifacts_total`/`truncated`), plus run-level `state`/`result_path`/`error_path` (the last set only for failed/timeout/cancelled runs with a result.txt). Used both by `write_manifest()` (instance, called from every terminal marker after daemon.json/result.txt are final, best-effort via `_safe`, persists `artifacts.json`) and by `_artifacts_summary`'s fallback for old/running runs that have no `artifacts.json`. `MANIFEST_VERSION` mirrors `data_version`

Both rows remain tagged `source="daemon"` + `em_id` + `run_id` so every row self-describes regardless of which ledger it lives in (`sum_token_ledger(scope="main_agent")` therefore excludes all rows of a daemon-local ledger; use `scope="all"` to total one). Standard ledger appends may also best-effort mirror to each ledger's sibling `log.sqlite.token_entries` sidecar; JSONL remains authoritative.
  ├── record_cli_tokens()           — accumulates external CLI usage into `daemon.json.cli_tokens` (`input/output/cached/thinking/calls`) for UI display only; never writes either token ledger; appends a `cli_usage` event (with raw usage) to `events.jsonl`
  ├── mark_done/failed/cancelled/timeout — terminal state markers (result.txt + preview on done); each sets `daemon.json.state` to the authoritative terminal status read back by `_on_emanation_done`, then calls `write_manifest()` to persist `artifacts.json` capturing the final artifact set
  ├── claim_terminal_notification() / clear_terminal_notification_claim() / mark_terminal_notification_published() — terminal notification state machine: pending claim blocks concurrent callbacks, failed enqueue clears the claim for retry, and only the post-publication receipt sets `daemon.json.terminal_notified=true` (`daemon/run_dir.py:887-937`); `mark_terminal_notification_published_on_disk()` persists the same receipt for restart reconciliation (`daemon/run_dir.py:940-962`)

```

## Key Invariants

- **No recursion:** `EMANATION_BLACKLIST` prevents emanations from spawning sub-emanations, avatars, psyche, the skill catalog, or codex-style recursive agent execution.
- **Tool surface isolation:** `_ToolCollector` ensures preset-driven capability setup does not mutate the parent agent's tool registry.
- **Filesystem isolation:** Each manager-created emanation gets one compact-id run directory such as `daemons/em-a1b2/` or `daemons/em-a1b2-1/` on collision; legacy direct `DaemonRunDir` callers may still create the older timestamp/hash folder form. `DaemonRunDir` uses atomic `os.replace` for `daemon.json` and single-writer append-only JSONL for events/chat history.
- **Startup reaps stale parent-owned records:** `DaemonManager.__init__` scans only the current agent working directory's `daemons/*/daemon.json` files and marks `running`/`active` records as `failed` when their recorded `parent_pid` no longer exists. It does not reconstruct in-memory registry entries from disk.
- **Startup retries unpublished terminal notifications:** after stale-parent reaping, `DaemonManager.__init__` scans terminal run dirs and republishes only `done`/`failed`/`cancelled`/`timeout` records that explicitly carry `terminal_notified=false`. A stale `terminal_notification_claim` on a new-schema record is retryable; legacy records with `terminal_notified=true` or with the key absent are treated conservatively as already handled. The retry uses `daemon-terminal:<run_id>` as the system-event idempotency key, deduping a publish-before-receipt crash while the original event remains in the capped 20-event `system.json` window; after dismissal or eviction, recovery may safely republish because the durable receipt was never falsely recorded.
- **Timeout vs. cancel distinction:** Separate `timeout_event` and `cancel_event` allow the run loop to call `mark_timeout()` vs. `mark_cancelled()` based on which signal fired first.
- **Watchdog timeout kills are batch-scoped, reclaim is global:** Port-owned Codex, Cursor, OpenCode-family, Qwen, and Kimi initial runs carry `group_id=run_dir.group_id`; ask handles are ungrouped. The watchdog targets the Port group while transitional Popen backends remain indexed by `_cli_procs`/`_cli_proc_groups`; reclaim/agent-stop sweeps both ownership systems. When all of a batch's futures finish, `_arm_batch_done_cancel` sets `cancel_event` so the completed batch's watchdog returns instead of waking later and scanning/killing.
- **Capacity control:** `max_emanations` caps concurrent subagents; completed futures are pruned before each new batch.
- **Preset authorization and validation are pre-flight:** For LingTai-backend batches, an unauthorized explicit `tasks[].preset` refuses the whole batch before preset loading, connectivity/capability checks, run-directory creation, scheduling, or dispatch. Authorized preset connectivity and capability instantiation are then checked before any emanation is scheduled. A single failure refuses the whole batch; omitted-preset and external-CLI paths do not use this authorization gate.
- **Dual token ledger (lingtai backend only):** For lingtai-backend emanations, token usage is written to both the daemon's own ledger and the parent's ledger with `source=daemon` attribution; safe codex-pool source/size/weight/model-scope telemetry from `UsageMetadata.extra` is projected once and copied to both rows, while all other extras are omitted. The token-ledger SQLite sidecar mirrors these JSONL rows but does not replace them. **CLI backends (claude, claude-p/claude-code, codex, opencode, cursor) deliberately do NOT write to either ledger** — they run as external processes with their own billing paths, and their cache-creation/cache-read semantics do not map cleanly onto the kernel's adapter accounting. Mixing them in would produce a misleading "lifetime totals" number. CLI-backend spend is visible to the agent through `daemon(check)` output (`last_output`, `cli_output` events, stderr), not through `sum_token_ledger`. **As UI-only exceptions, claude-p/claude-code persists the Claude Code stream-json `result` usage; Codex persists one `turn.completed` usage object per stream; MiMo Code records accepted source-reported `step_finish` usage into `daemon.json.cli_tokens` via `record_cli_tokens` (initial runs and `ask` follow-ups); and Cursor persists its source-reported stream-json `result` usage into `daemon.json.cli_tokens` via `record_cli_tokens` (initial runs and `ask` follow-ups)** so the TUI `/daemons` view can display them. Claude and Codex initial/follow-up usage is likewise recorded through `record_cli_tokens`; Codex disjoins `input_tokens` by subtracting `cached_input_tokens` and retains the raw source object in `cli_usage`; MiMo accepts only pinned 0.1.5 `step_finish` parts with duplicate `part.id` suppression and retains raw source counters; Cursor keeps its direct net `inputTokens`, sums `cacheReadTokens` + `cacheWriteTokens` into `cached`, retains the raw source object in `cli_usage`, and joins model only from a matching source `system/init` event while provider remains unknown. These fields are separate from `tokens`, are never written to either `token_ledger.jsonl`, and never feed `sum_token_ledger`.
- **CLI progress stays inspectable, not conversational:** Claude/Codex/OpenCode/MiMo Code/Qwen Code/Oh-My-Pi/Kimi Code/Cursor stdout or parsed transcript output is persisted as `cli_output` events plus `daemon.json.last_output`; completion/failure publishes a bounded `system` notification pointing the parent to `daemon(action="check", id=...)`.
- **Full results live on disk:** `mark_done()` writes complete terminal output to `result.txt`; `daemon.json.result_preview` and notification bodies stay bounded. For MCP-capable backends, the internal `daemon_completion.json` sentinel is written only by the model-visible `finish` MCP tool and is validated before success.
- **List is an index, not a second truth:** `daemon(action="list")` rebuilds its view from the active registry and each run directory's `daemon.json`/`.prompt`/result preview, with optional `contains`/`status`/`last` filtering. If `daemon.json` is missing, corrupt, or has a stale `data_version`, list writes a best-effort rebuilt JSON and includes its `migration` reason in the index. Full detail stays in `.prompt`, `result.txt`, and JSONL trace files.
- **Check survives refresh/molt via durable run dirs:** After a refresh/molt the parent gets a fresh `DaemonManager` whose `_emanations` registry is empty (`__init__` does not reconstruct registry entries from disk), but daemon terminal notifications still point at valid `daemons/<run_id>/result.txt` paths. `_handle_check` therefore falls back, on a registry miss, to `_resolve_historical_run_dir`: a new compact id exact-matches its folder name and resolves unambiguously with `source="history"`; a legacy short `handle` resolves only when it has a unique historical match. If several legacy run dirs share the same handle, check returns an ambiguity error with `match_count`/`latest_run_id` rather than injecting an unbounded `other_run_dirs` list. Live registry hits keep using the in-memory `DaemonRunDir` and are never flagged `history`. An id that matches neither memory nor disk still returns `Unknown emanation`.
- **Claude Code spawns get a sanitized env.** All Claude backend entry points (`_run_claude_interactive_emanation`, `_handle_ask_claude_interactive`, `_run_claude_code_emanation`, and `_handle_ask_cli`) build the subprocess env via `_claude_code_env()`, which copies `os.environ` and pops `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. LingTai loads `.env` from `~/.lingtai-tui/` early in startup, so an API key intended for the lingtai LLM adapter would otherwise leak into spawned `claude` processes and force them off the user's Claude Code subscription onto API billing — surfacing as `Credit balance is too low` even when the subscription is healthy. Print-mode stripped vars are logged once per spawn via `daemon_claude_code_env_stripped`; interactive Claude uses the same sanitized env while avoiding global `~/.claude*` writes. Codex spawns are unaffected (they use OpenAI creds). See GH #107.
- **`backend_options` is a CLI-backend-only argv passthrough.** Per-task `backend_options` (JSON object) is converted to argv tokens by `_backend_options_to_argv` (`daemon/__init__.py:373-428`) and appended to the CLI command before the task prompt by `_run_claude_interactive_emanation`, `_run_claude_code_emanation`, `_run_codex_emanation`, `_run_opencode_emanation`, `_run_mimocode_emanation`, `_run_qwen_code_emanation`, `_run_oh_my_pi_emanation`, `_run_kimicode_emanation`, and `_run_cursor_emanation`. Validation happens pre-flight in `_handle_emanate_cli` — a single bad spec refuses the whole batch with a clear `ValueError`. The resolved object + argv are persisted to `daemon.json` (`backend_options`, `backend_argv`) and logged as `daemon_backend_options`. The lingtai backend silently ignores the field. `daemon(action="ask")` does not re-pass options — `--resume` / `exec resume` / `--session` reuses the session as-is (Qwen Code currently rejects ask because no stable resume contract is wired). Harness-owned flags such as Claude's `--settings` / `--print` / `--output-format`, OpenCode-family `--format`, MiMo Code's additional session selectors (`--session`/`-s`, `--continue`/`-c`, `--fork`), Qwen Code prompt/approval flags, Oh-My-Pi `--mode` / `--approval-mode yolo` / session flags, and Kimi Code `--prompt` / `--output-format` / `--yolo` / session-`--continue` flags are rejected in `backend_options` before spawn by `_validate_claude_backend_argv` (`daemon/__init__.py:716-739`). Interactive Claude additionally consumes the LingTai-owned `--managed-worktree-from` option (`backend_options.managed_worktree_from`) before invoking Claude; it is not forwarded to the CLI.
- **Ask workers cannot block on silent stdout.** Port-owned Claude print-mode, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode-family ask workers pass an explicit monotonic deadline to `iter_stdout`; the Port enforces it and the worker terminates with `reason="timeout"`, clears `ask_in_flight`, and releases the handle. Interactive Claude PTY remains outside this headless boundary. Initial Port-owned streams have no local deadline because their batch watchdog remains authoritative.
- **CLI-backend `ask` is non-blocking; lingtai-backend `ask` is in-process.** `_handle_ask_claude_interactive` / `_handle_ask_cli` / `_handle_ask_codex` spawn the resumed CLI subprocess on the calling thread (so subprocess-launch errors like missing CLI surface synchronously) but hand the stream-json/JSONL parse loop to a dedicated `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`_ask_pool`, sized to `max_emanations`). The agent's `daemon(action="ask")` call returns `{"status":"sent","async":true}` within milliseconds; progress lands as `cli_output` events + `last_output` in the run_dir, and the final reply (or failure) is announced via `_publish_daemon_notification("follow-up completed"/"follow-up failed")`. The lingtai-backend path is unchanged — it buffers into the emanation's `followup_buffer` and is drained by the in-process run loop. A per-entry `ask_in_flight` flag (guarded by `followup_lock`) refuses a second concurrent ask with `{"status":"busy", ...}` because interactive `claude --resume`, print-mode `claude --resume`, and `codex exec resume` serialize per session and a second spawn would either error or interleave reply text. `_handle_reclaim` shuts down `_ask_pool` alongside the regular emanation pools and rebuilds a fresh one. This fixes the regression where a single `daemon(ask)` could hold the parent agent's tool turn for up to `self._timeout` seconds (default 3600). Parent agent stop/refresh uses the same cleanup path via `shutdown_for_agent_stop` / `_shutdown_runtime_resources` (`daemon/__init__.py:6391-6475`) before heartbeat/lock release, waiting on both primary daemon futures and CLI `ask_future` follow-up workers, so daemon executor workers and CLI child process groups cannot keep the old agent process alive after liveness is withdrawn.
- **CLI backends stream structured events where the CLI supports them, not buffered text.** `_run_claude_interactive_emanation` / `_handle_ask_claude_interactive` use a managed workspace + PTY + `SessionStart`/`Stop` hooks + transcript JSONL; `_run_claude_code_emanation` / `_handle_ask_cli` use `claude --output-format stream-json --verbose`; `_run_codex_emanation` / `_handle_ask_codex` use `codex exec --json`; `_run_opencode_emanation` / `_handle_ask_opencode`, `_run_mimocode_emanation` / `_handle_ask_mimocode`, and `_run_oh_my_pi_emanation` / `_handle_ask_oh_my_pi` parse OpenCode-family JSON events (Oh-My-Pi via `omp --mode json` whose first `type:session` header carries the resumable id); `_run_qwen_code_emanation` captures Qwen's headless stdout/stderr until a stable JSON/resume contract exists. The first event that carries a session id writes it to `daemon.json` (`claude_session_id`, `codex_session_id`, `opencode_session_id`, `mimocode_session_id`, `oh_my_pi_session_id`, or `cursor_session_id`) immediately — typically within ms of process start, well before any LLM work — so `daemon(action="ask")` is usable from the moment `emanate` returns for backends with resume support. stderr drains in a background thread to its own pipe (no longer merged into stdout), so API/auth/rate-limit errors surface as `cli_output` events with `stream="stderr"`. For claude-code: a final `result` event with `is_error=true` is surfaced as `mark_failed`, so an error inside the LLM stream doesn't masquerade as success even when the underlying process exits 0. For codex: absence of a `turn.completed` event (combined with no captured `agent_message`s) is treated as failure similarly. Codex's `--ephemeral` flag is intentionally NOT passed: it would disable session persistence and break `daemon(ask)`. See GH issues #99 / #100 / #101 for the prior buffered-text failure mode that motivated this design.
- **Detached daemon supervisor (unconditional all-backend route).** `_handle_emanate` validates and writes a secret-free manifest, then the POSIX adapter launches one detached supervisor per run. `execution_host.py` composes the existing `DaemonManager`/`_BackendSpec` setup and runners in that process, so LingTai, Claude, Codex, OpenCode, MiMo, Qwen, Oh-My-Pi, Kimi, and Cursor retain one production parser each. The supervisor owns deadline/control, exact child process groups, run-owned diagnostics, terminal `DaemonRunDir` truth, and notification publication; the parent manager retains only submit/inspect/control state. Presets, selected skills, task MCP registrations, and the built-in `daemon_common.finish` surface are reconstructed from the validated manifest and run directory. Resolved credentials are never written to the manifest; request/control files and supervisor logs use restrictive permissions where supported. `system.refresh`/agent stop only shuts down parent-local resources and cannot see detached futures or child handles.

## Two-axis `_meta` boundary

Daemon handlers are unchanged and their results use the canonical
`ToolResultBlock.metadata` sidecar. The daemon loop projects a daemon-local
`agent_meta.agent_state` (runtime identity, token counters, context usage, and
post-90% warning) onto the newest final result through
`kernel/meta_block.attach_daemon_agent_meta`; older snapshots remain historical.
Parent agent/session and notification/communication state is not shared or
injected. `llm/interface_converters.py` projects the sidecar for both dictionary
and string results without requiring handler wrappers and preserves the daemon's
intentional omission of the parent notification axis.

## Dependencies

- `lingtai.kernel.llm.base.FunctionSchema` — tool schema type
- `BaseAgent._enqueue_system_notification` — compact daemon completion/failure events
- `lingtai.kernel.token_ledger` — `append_token_entry` for token accounting
- `lingtai.i18n` — `t()` for localized strings
- `lingtai.tools.registry` — `setup_capability`, `_GROUPS` for preset sandbox instantiation
- `lingtai.presets` — `load_preset`, `expand_inherit` for per-emanation preset resolution
- `lingtai.kernel.preset_connectivity` — `check_connectivity` for LLM reachability pre-flight
- `lingtai.kernel.config_resolve` — `resolve_env` for API key resolution
- `lingtai.llm.service` — `LLMService` for dedicated preset LLM services
- `lingtai.agent.Agent` — parent agent type (TYPE_CHECKING only)

## Composition

- **Parent:** `src/lingtai/tools/` (tool package).
- **Siblings:** `avatar/`, `mcp/`, `knowledge/` (private durable memory), `skills/` (skill catalog), canonical `shell` (retained `bash/` implementation).
- **Summary composition edge:** `_build_daemon_apriori_summarizer_fn` in
  `daemon/__init__.py` closes over the effective daemon `LLMService` and
  `DaemonRunDir`; `_run_emanation` injects it into the kernel `ToolExecutor`.
  The executor retains raw-log and replacement ownership; the daemon logger
  exposes its run-local raw-result locator to the worker.
- **Manual:** `daemon/manual/SKILL.md` — skill documentation for the LLM.
- **Contract:** `daemon/CONTRACT.md` — unified daemon contract for tool-surface behavior, selected skills, one-run MCP registrations, completion, artifacts, backend support status, review triggers, and acceptance gates.
- **Kernel hooks:** `setup()` is called during capability initialization; `DaemonManager.handle()` is registered as the `daemon` tool handler.
