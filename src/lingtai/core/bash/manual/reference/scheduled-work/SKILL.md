# Scheduled Work Reference

Nested bash-manual reference. Open this when the top-level `bash-manual` router
selects host-scheduler setup for recurring or time-driven work.

## Scheduled / cron-driven work

## When to use scheduled work

Scheduled work is for things that should happen *because time has passed*, not because someone sent a message. Three patterns to distinguish:

1. **Time-driven, agent-acts** — "every hour, write one poem and ship it." Time is the trigger; the agent does the substantive work. **This is what cron is for.**
2. **Event-driven, time-tolerant** — "when an email arrives, reply within an hour." The event is the trigger; time is just a deadline. Use the event source (IMAP poller, webhook, mailbox watch), not cron.
3. **Inside-the-turn periodic** — "while you're already in a turn, also check Z if 30 minutes have passed since last check." This is a turn-loop idiom (compare `time.time()` against a stored timestamp), not external scheduling.

If the human says "do X every hour" and X is substantive, you want pattern 1. If they say "be quick when Y happens," pattern 2. If they say "while you're at it, also Z," pattern 3.

**Don't reach for cron when a `Monitor`/watch will do.** A poll loop fires whether or not anything changed and will burn tokens on empty cycles. Cron is appropriate when the work is unconditional ("write a poem regardless") or when the polling-vs-events tradeoff genuinely favors polling (cheap check, source has no event channel).

## The wake-by-mailbox-drop contract

The LingTai kernel has **no built-in scheduler**. Cron jobs interact with you the same way humans and other agents do: by writing a `message.json` to your outbox-side mailbox.

The full contract:

1. The cron script generates a UUID and writes one file:
   `<project>/.lingtai/human/mailbox/outbox/<uuid>/message.json` (when the human is the sender).
   Human is a pseudo-agent, so the file goes to the **human outbox**, not directly to your inbox. Your kernel polls every active human outbox and claims messages addressed to you on the next cycle.
2. The kernel sees the message addressed to you, atomically renames the folder to `human/mailbox/sent/<uuid>/`, and copies it into `<your-agent>/mailbox/inbox/<uuid>/`.
3. On your next turn, you read the inbox, see the new message, and act.

That's it. **Anything that can write a JSON file to the outbox can wake you on a schedule.** launchd, systemd, crontab, `at`, an IFTTT webhook, a different agent's behavior — all the same to you.

Message template (the cron script generates this, fills in `${UUID}`, `${SUBJECT}`, `${BODY}`, `${TIMESTAMP}`):

```json
{
  "id": "${UUID}",
  "_mailbox_id": "${UUID}",
  "from": "human",
  "to": ["<your-address>"],
  "cc": [],
  "subject": "${SUBJECT}",
  "message": ${BODY_AS_JSON_STRING},
  "type": "normal",
  "received_at": "${TIMESTAMP}",
  "identity": {
    "address": "human",
    "agent_name": "human",
    "via": "<scheduler-name>-cron"
  }
}
```

Use `via: "<scheduler-name>-cron"` (e.g. `"launchd-cron"`, `"systemd-cron"`) so you can tell scheduled mail apart from interactive mail in your audit log.

## When to write the prompt — short, not long

A common anti-pattern: stuffing the full operational recipe ("write a poem, then run mmx with these flags, then commit, then push, then trigger the workflow…") into the cron script's prompt body. This is wrong on two axes:

- **The prompt is replayed every hour.** Updating the recipe means editing the cron script, redeploying, often touching launchd or systemd. Friction.
- **The recipe IS knowledge that belongs to YOU.** Encode it in a custom skill at `.library/custom/<recipe-name>/SKILL.md`. The prompt then says "use your `<recipe-name>` skill" and is one sentence. The skill is editable in-place, version-controlled, and discoverable to other agents on the same network.

Rule: **cron prompts wake you and supply the time-bound context (which hour, what just changed). Skills supply the procedure.**

Example (libai's hourly poem cron):

```
太白吾兄，又是一个时辰。
此刻乃${HOUR_NOTE}（${NOW_LOCAL}）。
请援用 `hourly-poem` 之技——观当世一事，作诗一首，配乐一曲，并刊于网。
所有步骤、路径、命令皆备于该技中，依之而行即可。
```

That's the entire prompt. Six lines. The 200-line recipe lives in the skill.

## Hygiene — the rules that keep scheduled scripts alive

### 1. Idempotent

A cron script must be safe to run **twice in a row** with no harm. Cron fires on a wall clock; nothing prevents two firings from racing (system clock changes, missed-then-caught-up firings, double-loaded launchd plists). Always check "did the work already happen for this cycle?" before doing it again.

For mail-drop scripts, idempotency comes for free if you generate a fresh UUID per fire — duplicate mail in the inbox is annoying but harmless. For scripts that DO work (e.g. running a generator), guard with a marker file:

```bash
MARK="$WORKDIR/.last-fire-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H)"
[ -f "$MARK" ] && exit 0     # already ran this hour
# ... do the work ...
touch "$MARK"
```

### 2. Audit the previous cycle on every fire

Every fire is also a chance to verify the *previous* fire actually completed. Add an audit block at the top of the script:

```bash
# Did anything land where it should have, in the last 75 minutes?
RECENT=$(git -C "$REPO" log origin/main --since="75 minutes ago" --oneline | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
if [ "$RECENT" = "0" ]; then
  echo "$(date -Iseconds) [audit] WARN: no commits in last 75min — last cron may have failed" >> "$LOG_FILE"
fi
```

Cron failures are silent by default. Audit-on-next-fire turns the silence into a log line you can grep for.

### 3. Append to a log file; never trust stdout/stderr

launchd and systemd capture stdout/stderr to the paths you configure, but those files often get rotated, cleared on system updates, or simply forgotten. Your script should always also write to its own log:

```bash
LOG_FILE="${HOME}/.lingtai-tui/cron/<job-name>.log"
log() { echo "$(date -Iseconds) $*" >> "$LOG_FILE"; }
log "[fire] starting cycle"
```

Tag each line with a category (`[send]`, `[audit]`, `[refresh]`, `[err]`) so you can grep specific events later. Use ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone (`date -Iseconds`) — relative timestamps lie when the system reboots.

### 4. `set -euo pipefail` always

Without this, a typo or a transient error mid-script silently continues, leaving partial state. With it, any failure aborts the script and you see the failure in the log.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
```

If you genuinely need a command's failure to be ignored, opt in explicitly: `cmd || true`.

### 5. Absolute paths for binaries

launchd and systemd run with a sparse `PATH`. `git`, `gh`, `python3` may not be on `$PATH` even if they work fine in your shell. Use absolute paths:

```bash
GIT="/usr/bin/git"
GH="/opt/homebrew/bin/gh"
PYTHON="${HOME}/.lingtai-tui/runtime/venv/bin/python"
```

Or set `PATH` explicitly at the top of the script. Don't trust the inherited one.

### 6. Dropping mail does NOT wake the agent — it just queues

Writing to the outbox is the queue, not the doorbell. The agent will see the mail on its next turn cycle. If it's actively in a long-running turn or asleep, the mail waits until the next active turn.

If you need the agent to act on the mail *promptly* (within seconds), follow the mail-drop with `touch .refresh` and **stop there**. The kernel's `_perform_refresh` (`base_agent/lifecycle.py:_perform_refresh`) handles the rest: it spawns a deferred-relaunch watcher that waits for `.agent.lock` to release and then `Popen`s the new agent itself. The cron script does not need to wait, does not need to verify, does not need to relaunch.

```bash
# Mail-drop already done above (writing message.json under human/mailbox/outbox/<uuid>/).
# Now nudge the agent to pick it up immediately:
touch "$PROJECT_ROOT/.lingtai/<agent>/.refresh"
# Done. Exit. The kernel's refresh watcher handles shutdown + relaunch.
```

That's the entire refresh recipe. If the human just wants the work done eventually (within the next active turn), even the `touch .refresh` is overhead — drop the mail and exit.

#### Anti-pattern — DO NOT do any of these

The following pattern looks reasonable but causes **duplicate-agent accumulation** (multiple Python interpreters all running against the same workdir, observed in vivo as 6 stacked PIDs after 6 hourly fires):

```bash
# ❌ DANGEROUS — do not copy this pattern
touch "$LIBAI_DIR/.refresh"
WAIT_DEADLINE=$(($(date +%s) + 60))
while [ -e "$LIBAI_DIR/.agent.lock" ]; do
  [ $(date +%s) -gt $WAIT_DEADLINE ] && rm -f "$LIBAI_DIR/.agent.lock" && break
  sleep 0.5
done
"$VENV_PYTHON" "$RELAUNCH_SCRIPT" ...   # parallel relaunch
```

Two failure modes baked in:

1. **Path-existence check on `.agent.lock` is racy.** The kernel uses `fcntl.flock` for mutual exclusion, not the file's mere presence. The lockfile vanishes near the *end* of `_stop()`, but the Python interpreter can linger 30–60s after that doing HTTP teardown, mail-listener stop, and MCP child reaping. Polling for the path to disappear and then spawning a new agent races a still-living process.

2. **`rm -f .agent.lock` on timeout is destructive.** flock is invisible to `rm`; you delete the path while the kernel still considers itself the owner. The new agent then creates a fresh lockfile at the same path and acquires flock on that — so you have two agents, each holding flock on a different inode at the same path. When the old process finishes shutdown and calls its tail-end `unlink(.agent.lock, missing_ok=True)`, it can delete the **new** agent's lockfile.

3. **Parallel relaunch races the kernel's own watcher.** `touch .refresh` already triggers `_perform_refresh`, which spawns a deferred-relaunch process (see `base_agent/lifecycle.py:_perform_refresh`) that does the wait-for-lock-then-spawn dance correctly. Adding your own relaunch in the cron means two processes are racing to be "the new agent." Whichever loses the flock will sit in `acquire_lock(timeout=10)` for 10 seconds and then crash, but during those 10 seconds you have two Python processes visible in `ps`.

**Rule:** if you find yourself parsing `.agent.lock`, polling for it, or removing it from a script, stop. The lock is the kernel's. Touch `.refresh` and exit.

### 7. No janitors in the cron prompt unless the human asked

Cron scripts and the skills they invoke should never silently delete work products ("janitor old mp3s," "prune old logs"). Deletion is a design decision, not a hygiene step. If the human wants pruning, they will ask for it explicitly. Otherwise leave artifacts alone — disk is cheap, lost work isn't.

## macOS — launchd

On macOS, the right scheduler is **launchd** (not cron). cron exists on macOS but is deprecated; launchd is the system-managed equivalent and behaves correctly across sleep/wake, reboots, and login sessions.

### Plist template

Save to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<reverse-domain-name>.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>ai.example.my-job</string>

  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/bin/bash</string>
    <string>/Users/yourname/.scripts/my-job.sh</string>
  </array>

  <!-- Pick ONE of StartCalendarInterval or StartInterval -->

  <!-- Fire at minute 0 every hour: -->
  <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
  <dict>
    <key>Minute</key>
    <integer>0</integer>
  </dict>

  <!-- OR fire every N seconds: -->
  <!-- <key>StartInterval</key> <integer>300</integer> -->

  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <false/>

  <key>StandardOutPath</key>
  <string>/Users/yourname/.scripts/my-job.out</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
  <string>/Users/yourname/.scripts/my-job.err</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Loading

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.example.my-job.plist
launchctl list | grep ai.example.my-job   # verify it's loaded
launchctl start ai.example.my-job         # fire once for testing
```

### Unloading

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.example.my-job.plist
```

A plist edit only takes effect after `unload` + `load` (or after a reboot).

### macOS gotcha: launchd process-tree reaping

If your cron script needs to **launch a long-running daemon as a side effect** (e.g. relaunching a LingTai agent after dropping mail + refreshing), launchd will kill that daemon when the script exits unless you fully detach it.

Symptom: the script's child process (your agent) starts, you see its log briefly, then it dies seconds after the script returns.

Cause: launchd reaps the entire process tree of a job when the job's `ProgramArguments` process exits. `&` and `disown` (which work in interactive shells) do nothing under launchd because there's no shell job-control table.

Fix: **double-fork the daemon** so it ends up with PPID=1 (init), fully detached:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# fork-exec helper — call from the cron script
import os, sys, subprocess

def daemonize():
    if os.fork() > 0: os._exit(0)   # parent exits
    os.setsid()                      # detach from controlling terminal
    if os.fork() > 0: os._exit(0)   # first child exits
    # grandchild: PPID is now 1
    os.chdir("/")
    sys.stdin = open("/dev/null", "r")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_cmd = sys.argv[1:]
    daemonize()
    log_path = os.environ.get("DAEMON_LOG", "/tmp/daemon.log")
    with open(log_path, "ab") as f:
        subprocess.Popen(target_cmd, stdout=f, stderr=f, start_new_session=True)
```

The cron script calls this helper and exits — the grandchild survives.

### Useful launchctl commands

```bash
launchctl list | grep <prefix>             # which of my jobs are loaded
launchctl list ai.example.my-job           # full status (PID, last exit code)
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/ai.example.my-job   # newer macOS — full diagnostic
log show --predicate 'process == "launchd"' --last 1h | grep ai.example   # system log lines
```

`launchctl list <label>` shows `LastExitStatus`. **Non-zero ≠ broken** (your script may exit nonzero on intentional skip paths), but a sudden change from 0 to nonzero is worth investigating.

## Linux — systemd timer

On modern Linux, systemd timers are the right primitive. Two unit files: a `.service` (what to run) and a `.timer` (when to run).

`~/.config/systemd/user/my-job.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My hourly job

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/yourname/.scripts/my-job.sh
StandardOutput=append:/home/yourname/.scripts/my-job.out
StandardError=append:/home/yourname/.scripts/my-job.err
```

`~/.config/systemd/user/my-job.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run my-job every hour

[Timer]
OnCalendar=hourly
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Activation:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now my-job.timer
systemctl --user list-timers          # verify scheduled
systemctl --user status my-job.service
journalctl --user -u my-job.service   # logs
```

`Persistent=true` matters: if the machine was off when a fire was scheduled, the timer will fire on next boot to "catch up." Drop it if catch-up firings are unwanted (e.g., "post the morning poem" should not post 3 backed-up poems after a weekend power-out).

## Linux fallback — crontab

If systemd isn't available (containers, minimal distros), use crontab. Edit:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add a line:

```
0 * * * * /bin/bash /home/yourname/.scripts/my-job.sh >> /home/yourname/.scripts/my-job.log 2>&1
```

5 fields: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`. The default `PATH` for crontab is even sparser than launchd's — set `PATH=` at the top of the crontab file or use absolute paths everywhere in the script.
