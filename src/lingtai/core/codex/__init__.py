"""Deprecated compatibility wrapper for the renamed knowledge capability.

The private durable knowledge capability formerly lived at ``lingtai.core.codex`` and
registered the ``codex`` tool. It now lives in ``lingtai.core.library`` and registers canonical
``knowledge`` plus temporary ``library``/``codex`` tool aliases. Keep this module so imports
and direct capability setup through the old module path continue to work during
migration.
