"""Per-account poller lockfile for the WeChat addon.

iLink's getUpdates is a single-consumer long-poll: when two processes hold
the same bot_token and both call getUpdates, each call may receive a
different subset of messages, and there is no way for either consumer to
know it is racing. The practical symptom is "inbound messages appear flaky"
— see GH issue #83. This module prevents that by taking an exclusive
fcntl.flock on a per-account lockfile in the user's runtime directory.

The lock key hashes the bot_token (which is the only stable identifier of
the iLink account from the addon's perspective). The lockfile path is
deterministic across processes/working-dirs on the same machine, so a
second poller for the same account on the same host is reliably refused.

Platform note: this module is POSIX-only. ``acquire()`` raises
``UnsupportedPlatformError`` if ``fcntl`` is unavailable (e.g. on Windows)
rather than silently no-opping, since a silent no-op would leave issue #83
unresolved while pretending the lock had been taken.
