"""Public ``task_card`` controller — programmable Telegram Task Card watches.

Model-facing controller for the *programmable* slot of Telegram's one tracked
resident Task Card target (Jason #7258/#7259). Telegram never executes code: the agent
writes a Python renderer file under its own workdir whose stdout is exactly one
schema-valid Task Card JSON object; the controller runs it with the runtime
interpreter under a strict timeout, validates the JSON, and forwards only
validated data to the private ``_lingtai_telegram_task_card`` reverse channel.
``TelegramManager`` stays the single render/compose/persistence owner (no
competing system). Fail-loud is the kernel notification wake
(``_enqueue_system_notification``); all model-facing copy is English-only.

This unit is Telegram MCP-owned: registration is gated by the Telegram reverse
route, projection targets ``_lingtai_telegram_task_card``, and the Telegram
manager/server/service own the resident slots, in-place edits, toggle,
persistence, transport, and rendering destination. The controller depends only
on the narrow :class:`~.interface.TelegramTaskCardAgent` host surface, never on
the concrete ``Agent`` class. See the co-located ``CONTRACT.md`` for the
interface promise and ``SKILL.md`` for the model-facing manual.
