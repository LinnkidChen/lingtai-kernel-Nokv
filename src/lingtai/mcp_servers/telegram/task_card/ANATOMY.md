# Telegram Programmable Task Card Anatomy

The Telegram-owned Task Card unit drives the programmable slot and names the
resident boundary shared with the automatic event projection. `TaskCardResident`
owns channel frames, per-account+chat locks, compose, atomic enablement, and
the deterministic project/ensure boundary; `TelegramManager` remains the
Telegram transport adapter for the hard-at-most-one / last-message transaction.
The model-facing `task_card` tool runs an agent-supplied Python renderer and
projects only validated data onto that same resident target. The co-located manual
teaches agents to inspect each task and producer, choose truthful evidence, and
adapt a watcher after meaningful use; it does not prescribe a renderer layout or
data source. Normative promises live in the paired [`CONTRACT.md`](CONTRACT.md).

## Components

- `get_schema` / `get_description` — the `task_card` tool schema (`start` /
  `inspect` / `retry` / `stop`) and the description that routes to the manual
  (`controller.py:59`, `controller.py:100`).
- `TaskCardResident` — resident owner for channel frames, route locks, atomic
  enablement, and `ensure`/`project` (`resident.py:9`).
- `TaskCardController` — thin Core: dispatch, synchronous first frame, watch
  registry, fail-loud/recovery wakes (`controller.py:179`). Key methods:
  `handle` (`controller.py:188`), `_start` (`controller.py:213`), `_inspect`
  (`controller.py:281`), `_run_renderer` (`controller.py:597`), `_validate_frame`
  (`controller.py:623`), `_project` (`controller.py:670`),
  `_validate_renderer_path` (`controller.py:746`), `_resolve_route`
  (`controller.py:785`), `shutdown_for_agent_stop` (`controller.py:810`).
  `_start` (`controller.py:213`) also keeps the watch addressable on a validated
  initial persistence-partial (`resident_persist_failed` with a route-matching id)
  rather than discarding it, and discards on any other first-frame error.
- Stop lifecycle (never finalize/remove/`stopped` while the watcher thread is
  alive): `_stop` (`controller.py:301`), the post-projection late-`update` guard
  and compensation in `_tick` (`controller.py:426`), and
  `_compensate_stop_finalize` (`controller.py:477`) with the `finalized`
  watcher↔public-stop handshake.
- Outcome validation: `_project` (`controller.py:670`) normalizes the manager's
  `resident_persist_failed` (→ observable partial surfacing the validated
  `message_id`) and treats pre-send `stale_delete_failed` / `indeterminate_send` /
  any malformed id as a plain error (no adopted id). `_route_matched_message_id`
  (`controller.py:720`) independently validates every returned compound id — route
  match to `watch.account`/`watch.chat_id` plus a positive-integer terminal id —
  for both clean and partial outcomes.
- `_Watch` — per-watch in-memory state: thread, last-valid frame + timestamp,
  sticky `stopping`, `finalized` handshake flag, deduped error/epoch bookkeeping
  (`controller.py:118`).
- `setup(agent, controller=...)` — registers the controller-bound `task_card`
  handler and its schema with `glossary_package=None`, reusing an existing
  controller when a full Agent refresh rebuilds the public tool registries
  (`controller.py:821`).
- `TelegramTaskCardAgent` — the narrow host Protocol the controller depends on
  instead of the concrete `Agent` (`interface.py:25`). Its required
  `_call_mcp_owned_tool` member is the leased reverse-call boundary that keeps a
  selected Telegram transport alive across concurrent refresh/stop retirement.

## Connections

- Composition root: `Agent._maybe_setup_task_card_controller`
  (`src/lingtai/agent.py:1023-1064`; `setup` call at
  `src/lingtai/agent.py:1064`) calls `setup` only after the newly rebuilt
  reverse-route map contains Telegram; it re-registers the same controller after a
  full refresh clears the public tool surface or a colliding MCP overwrites it,
  verifying the handler binding and owned schema rather than a name/count alone. It
  runs at the end of each MCP-connect path that may add the Telegram route
  (`src/lingtai/agent.py:1020`, `src/lingtai/agent.py:1121`).
- Renderer: `_run_renderer` runs `sys.executable <renderer>` with the agent
  workdir as `cwd`; `_validate_renderer_path` confines the path to that workdir.
- Reverse channel: `_project` asks the host Protocol's
  `_call_mcp_owned_tool` boundary to lease the published `telegram` route, then
  calls the private `_lingtai_telegram_task_card` tool with
  `channel="programmable"`. Refresh/stop can depublish the route immediately
  but waits for this bounded lease before closing the client. The outcome is consumed by
  `TelegramManager._handle_task_card_update` (`src/lingtai/mcp_servers/telegram/manager.py`).
- Route: `_resolve_route` reads the programmable controller's turn-local
  `agent._telegram_task_card_context` so its frames resolve to the one tracked
  resident target for that account+chat; the automatic event-tail broadcast is
  manager-owned and does not use this route.
- Transport ownership: the manager (`_deliver_channel_frame_locked`,
  `_rotate_task_card_to_latest`, `_replace_task_card_after_probe`) owns the
  hard-at-most-one / last-message resident transport; `_project` only reads its
  normalized `{status}`/`partial`/`resident_persist_failed`/`stale_delete_failed`/
  `indeterminate_send` outcome. The manager's `send_progress_message` forms a
  compound id only after `_sent_message_id_or_none` confirms a real positive `int`,
  else returns `indeterminate_send` so cold-send/old-first replacement fail closed.
- Fail-loud: after-handle failures call `agent._enqueue_system_notification`.

## Automatic event-tail projection paths

- **Rows/timestamps:** after validating `type == "tool_call"`,
  `_project_tool_call_row` reads only `tool_name`, redacted/bounded
  `tool_args._reasoning`, and top-level Unix-epoch `ts`; raw action is excluded.
  `_format_task_card_row_timestamp` projects a valid value as optional
  `started_at` in `HH:MM:SS UTC±HH`; missing, boolean, non-numeric, non-finite,
  or out-of-range values omit it. `_meta`, row arguments, notifications, and
  render time are never timestamp sources. Navigation:
  `manager.py:_project_tool_call_row` (`:1934`), `_format_task_card_row_timestamp`
  (`:2005`), and `_format_rows_task_card_text` (`:2864`).
- **Current telemetry:** `_project_final_carrier_metadata` accepts only a
  final-carrier `type == "notification_block_injected"` event's latest whole
  `_meta.agent_meta`, then projects
  `_meta.agent_meta.agent_state.token_usage.session` fields
  `session_cache_rate`, `cache_miss_tokens`, `cache_miss_budget`, `api_calls`,
  `context_tokens`, `context_window`, and `context_usage`. The tail stores no
  historical holders and passes this bounded projection to the existing
  `_format_task_card_metadata` two-line/150-character formatter through
  `_broadcast_task_card_event_window`; malformed or missing values omit safely.
  It never reads retired `tool_meta.token_usage`, row args, notifications, or
  render time. Navigation: `manager.py:_project_final_carrier_metadata`
  (`:1966`), `_reverse_tail_latest_rows` (`:2073`), `_append_new_lines`
  (`:2226`), and `_broadcast_task_card_event_window` (`:2305`).
- **Two independent channels, each following only its own update path.** The
  automatic channel is updated ONLY by `_poll_event_tail` (`manager.py:2176`) →
  `_broadcast_task_card_event_window` (`manager.py:2305`); its footer line is
  `Last Updated: HH:MM:SS UTC±HH` (`_TASK_CARD_TIME_PREFIX`, `manager.py:111`),
  meaning when that event-tail snapshot was last rendered — not a wall clock
  tied to unrelated programmable edits. The programmable channel is updated
  ONLY by `_task_card_programmable` (`manager.py:2694`) →
  `_format_programmable_card_text` (`manager.py:1774`), which appends its own
  `Last Updated` line to every non-empty frame, meaning when that programmable
  frame itself was accepted/rendered for delivery. `_deliver_channel_frame_locked`
  (`manager.py:1668`) composes and commits exactly the one `channel` it was
  called for via `_compose_channels`/`_set_channel_frame` (`manager.py:1644`,
  `:1638`) — it never reads or mutates the other channel's stored frame, the
  event-tail offset/metadata/groups, or session state. So an automatic update
  always leaves the committed programmable frame byte-for-byte unchanged, and a
  programmable update always leaves the committed automatic frame and session
  footer byte-for-byte unchanged. Navigation: `manager.py:_poll_event_tail`,
  `_broadcast_task_card_event_window`, `_deliver_channel_frame_locked`,
  `_compose_channels`, `_set_channel_frame`, `_task_card_programmable`,
  `_format_programmable_card_text`; `resident.py:TaskCardResident.set_frame`,
  `.compose`.
- **Regression/drift triggers:** the event-to-final-render coverage is
  `tests/test_telegram_task_card_event_tail.py:test_event_log_final_carrier_projects_session_telemetry_into_final_render`
  plus `test_malformed_current_telemetry_carrier_clears_previous_snapshot` and
  the adjacent timestamp/malformed-input cases. Two-channel independence
  coverage is `test_automatic_footer_label_is_last_updated`,
  `test_programmable_frame_includes_its_own_last_updated_line`,
  `test_programmable_update_leaves_automatic_frame_unchanged`, and
  `test_automatic_update_leaves_programmable_frame_unchanged`. Update this
  anatomy and the paired contract/tests together if event types, the
  final-carrier metadata path, supported session fields, the two-line
  formatter budget, or timestamp provenance changes; do not broaden the
  automatic source without revisiting the authoritative-event rule, and do not
  reintroduce any cross-channel read/refresh — the two channels' update paths
  must stay fully independent.

## Composition

- **Parent:** [`src/lingtai/mcp_servers/ANATOMY.md`](../../ANATOMY.md).
- **Paired contract:** [`CONTRACT.md`](CONTRACT.md).
- **Automatic slot owner:** `TelegramManager`'s `logs/events.jsonl` tail
  worker and broadcast in `src/lingtai/mcp_servers/telegram/manager.py` (see
  `src/lingtai/mcp_servers/ANATOMY.md`); BaseAgent no longer builds or renders
  automatic rows.
- **Programmable route host:** the kernel Task Card hooks in
  [`src/lingtai/kernel/base_agent/ANATOMY.md`](../../../kernel/base_agent/ANATOMY.md)
  capture only the turn-local `{account, chat_id}` route this controller
  reads; render/compose/persistence for both channels stays in
  `src/lingtai/mcp_servers/telegram/manager.py`.
- **Manual:** [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). It is the task-specific procedure: inspect
  the producer evidence, design a truthful frame for purpose/time/activity/tokens/
  state-gate-blocker, use the retained controller lifecycle, and ask for feedback
  after meaningful use before extracting a reusable skill. It includes a safe
  runnable custom-renderer example, but does not define a fixed layout or source.

## State

The resident module holds only in-memory channel frames, route locks, and the
observed enablement transition. Resident message ids remain in the existing
TelegramAccount `task_cards` state map; event history remains `events.jsonl`.
The controller holds only in-memory per-watch state (`_watches`, threads,
last-valid frames, error epochs). It writes no files and deletes none — renderer
files are agent-owned working-directory copies selected for the current task and
are never deleted by the controller.
Durable Task Card state (resident message id per account+chat, composed slots,
the `/taskcard` delivery boolean) is owned by the Telegram adapter, not here
(see `src/lingtai/mcp_servers/ANATOMY.md`).

## Notes

- Telegram never executes agent code: the controller forwards only a validated
  card object, never the renderer, over the reverse channel.
- The first frame is synchronous, so a failing renderer yields a tool error and
  no watch handle; after-handle failures preserve the last valid frame and emit
  one deduped, per-episode wake plus one recovery wake.
- `_TASK_CARD_TOOL` here mirrors `lingtai.kernel.base_agent._TASK_CARD_TOOL` and
  `telegram/server.py:_PRIVATE_TASK_CARD_TOOL`; the three must stay in sync.
